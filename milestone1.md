## Project Proposal
Our project aims to help bridge the gap between parents and older generations who feel disconnected from their children or other people in younger generations. The application serves to help translate English words and sentences containing slang into pure, formal English. Additionally, users of the application will be able to continually practice slang with flash cards and customized tests.

None of us consider ourselves to be out of touch with modern slang, but we can see how older generations might see this as an obstacle in developing relationships with younger people. We hope to help address this need with our application by making this information more accessible.
