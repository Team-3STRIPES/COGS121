## Project 
### Final Idea 
In Milestone 1, our team proposed a Slang Translator and a ASL Translator. After looking over the TA feedback, we chose to move forward with the Slang Translator because the ASL Translator may not provide any benefits since ASL signers can type.  

### UI Skeleton
INSERT UI SKELETON

In our UI skeletons, all of the original features that were shown on our prototypes were incorporated into our UI skeleton. As we fleshed out our skeletons, we added some changes. In our home page, we included text to speech buttons on both sides of the translator so that users can listen to how both slang and formal language is pronounced. We also made the right side of the translator display "Translation" by default when nothing has been inputed so the user is informed which side of the translator produces the translation.
