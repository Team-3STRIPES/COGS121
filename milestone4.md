## UI Progress

## User Action 1: Translate Slang
The slang translator is our main user action. It works similarly to Google Translate: on the home page, you click on the left textbox and type your text to be translated, and the translation will display in the right textbox.

## User Action 2: Study Flash Cards
Studying flash cards is a secondary functionality where the user can auto-generate and go through flash cards of previously defined slang terms. To go to study flash cards, on the home page, click on the top-right link labeled "Profile", then on the profile page, click on the lefthand side yellow box labeled "Study Flash Cards" to access the user's cards. From there, the user can view different flash cards by clicking on the arrows on either side of the flash card.
