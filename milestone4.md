## UI Progress

## User Action 1: Translate Slang
Translating slang with the slang translator is our core functionality. On the home page, click on the left textbox and input the slang that you would like to be translated, and the translation will display in the right textbox.

## User Action 2: Study Flash Cards
Studying flash cards is a secondary functionality where the user can auto-generate and go through flash cards of previously defined slang terms. To go to "Study Flash Cards", on the home page, click on the top-right link labeled "Profile", then on the profile page, click on the lefthand side yellow box labeled "Study Flash Cards" to access the user's cards. From there, the user can view different flash cards by clicking through the arrows on either side of the flash card deck.
