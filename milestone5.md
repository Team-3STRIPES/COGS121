## Purpose of "Translangtor"
The purpose of our slang translator would aid non-millenials in understanding current slang that they may be unfamiliar with. 
For example: Janine, while relaxing at home, noticed her son tweeted the word "lit" on Twitter as she was scrolling through social media. 
Janine doesn't know what "lit" means. Concerned that he might be using profanity that she's unaware of, Janine grabs her laptop 
and searches for the "Translangtor". She logs into her account through Google and types in "lit" into the translator. After a couple seconds, 
the words "amazing; spectacular; very good" display on Janine's screen. Relieved that her adolescent son isn't using profanity on Twitter, 
Janine closes her laptop and continues to go about her day.
